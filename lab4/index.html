	<h1>Lab 4</h1>
	<p>For this lab we pasted in some psuedocode so that we will know how to use it when we eventually
	have need for making our own later in the semester.</p>
	<h3>Part 1: Psuedocode an everyday task</h3>
	<p>My task is cooking dinner:
	1. Find a recipie.<br>
	2. Gather ingredients.<br>
	3. Prepare the ingredients into the parts of the meal.<br>
	4. Cook on the stove, oven, etc. the parts of the meal that need to be cooked.<br>
	5. Prepare the parts of the meal to be eaten together.</p>
	<h3>Part 2: Pseudocode a computer task</h3>
	<p>Make a fly buzz around a webpage:<br>
		1.  Instantiate the fly<br>
	  1a. make the fly an object related to its image<br>
		2.  pick a starting position<br>
	  2a. pick a place off screen for the fly to start and fly in from<br>
		3.  move the fly<br>
	  3a. pick a random position and turn the fly to face it and have it move there<br>
		4.  check for click event<br>
	  4a. run a script that checks for a mouse click and check if its in the right position</p>
	<h3>Part 3: Turn pseudocode into comments</h3>
	<p><code>
	// Create a fly that buzzes aroud the page and can be swatted.<br>
	// A fly image will fly around the screen irraticly and randomly and when clicked, it will act as if swatted and fall down.<br>
	// @link idk what this is for.<br>
	// @file no file.<br>
