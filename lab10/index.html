	<h1>Lab 10</h1>
	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<p>I didn't really have many challenges with this lab it was pretty simple.<br>
		I alreaedy knew about functions so that part was easy.
	</p>
	<h3>Problems</h3>
	<p>
		Nah, didn't have any of those. I am padding this out so it looks better<br>
		How's your day going so far? Hope its going well.
	</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>
		Look at all these cool results. You can see them right here.<br>
		This text line is pure filler to make the website a little bigger.<br>
		Gotta make it longer so the website looks better.
